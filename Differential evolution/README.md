Abstract
Differential evolution (DE) is a popular evolutionary algorithm inspired by Darwinâ€™s theory of evolution and has been studied extensively to solve different areas of optimisation and engineering applications since its introduction by Storn in 1997. This study aims to review the massive progress of DE in the research community by analysing the 192 articles published on this subject from 1997 to 2021, particularly studies in the past five years. The methodology used to search for relevant DE papers and an overview of the original DE are firstly explained. Recent advances in the modifications proposed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the original DE are reviewed by analysing the strengths and weaknesses of each published work, followed by the potential applications of these DE variants in solving different real-world engineering problems. In contrast to most existing DE review papers, additional analyses are performed in this survey by investigating the impacts of various parameter settings on given DE variants to identify their optimal values required for solving certain problem classes. The qualities of modifications incorporated into selected DE variants are also evaluated by measuring the performance gains achieved in terms of search accuracy and/or efficiency against the original DE. The additional surveys conducted in this study are anticipated to provide more insightful perspectives for both beginners and experts of DE research, enabling their better understanding about current research trends and new motivations to outline appropriate strategic planning for future development works.
